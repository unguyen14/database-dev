# Database Design and Development Project

## Project Goal
The project aims to build a database from scratch for a hiking orgarnization, demonstrating step-by-step process from user requirement analysis, to identify entities and relationships with assumptions about cardinality and participation, EER modeling, relational schema, normalization, ending with the CRUD for illustrating purposes. 
In addition, 10 business queries are answered at the end, using advance SQL queries to generate reports.

## Methodologies and Tools:
- Relational Database with PostgreSQL
- ER and ERR Mapping with [diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/?src=about)
- 

## Workflow:
This project follows a [waterfall model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model), with the phases listed below.
1. User requirements analysis
2. Conceptual Design
3. Logical Design
4. Physical Design 
5. Normalization
6. CRUD Operation
7. Business Inquiries with Advance PostgreSQL
